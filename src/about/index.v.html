                <p>Our family has been in Tucson since the 1950â€™s. Robert J. Reilly, more commonly known as Bob, was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia Medical School.  He eventually made it out to Tucson with his wife Diane Tiffany, who also studied nursing at Columbia. Together, they built a family and Urological Associates of Southern Arizona. They laid the foundation of faith and love in our family that still permeates everything we do.</p>
                <p>In 2018, Bob developed cancer and later joined his Maker. During this time, our family experienced first hand what it means to care for a loved one during a time of crisis and pain. This experience is one of the driving factors behind Heritage Oaks. We were blessed to be able to care for Bob during his last years, but also know that many families do not have this luxury, which is why we are here to help with love and compassion.</p>

                <p>Heritage Oaks is a family owned and operated business that is focused on cultivating the dignity and celebrating the heritage of each and every guest. We do this through our relentless commitment to excellence in service and promotion of the independence of every guest we serve.</p>
                <p>At Heritage Oaks, we do not want people to come and exist with us, or even just live here; we want each guest to thrive, feeling like a part of the family and, at the same time, free to live the way he/she wants.</p>
